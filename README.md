### Pre-requisites

- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Laravel 9 or higher

## Installation

**Composer**

Xendivel utilizes Composer's package auto-discovery. All you need to do is to install Xendivel via composer and it will automatically register itself.

```bash
composer install glennraya/xendivel
```

## Initial Setup

### Xendit API Keys

Prior to using Xendivel, it's essential to have a Xendit account with properly configured API keys. Activation of your Xendit account for production is not necessary to test Xendivel's features. Test mode will be automatically enabled upon signing up for a Xendit account. Obtain your API keys from the following URLs:

- Secret Key/Public Key: https://dashboard.xendit.co/settings/developers#api-keys
- Webhook Verification Token: https://dashboard.xendit.co/settings/developers#webhooks

Generate `Money-In` `secret key` with `read` and `write` permissions from your dashboard API keys section.

After you acquired all these keys, please make sure you include them to your Laravel's `.env` file:

```ini
XENDIT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
XENDIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
XENDIT_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=your-webhook-verification-token
```

### Configure Laravel Mail (Optional)

Xendivel can send invoices to your customers as email attachments. To utilize this feature, ensure your [Laravel Mail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/mail#main-content)  is correctly set up. Before Xendivel dispatches invoice or refund email notifications, ensure your mail credentials are filled in your `.env` file.

```ini
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-mailer-host
MAIL_PORT=your-mailer-port
MAIL_USERNAME=your-mailer-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-mailer-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="fromaddress@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

### Jobs/Queues (Optional, but highly recommended)

Xendivel facilitates the queuing of email processes for background execution. If you intend to employ queued emails for tasks such as invoicing or refund notifications, ensure that you have properly configured Laravel's jobs/queues.

https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues#main-content

Then, make sure you have a queue worker running:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

Once you have successfully configured Laravel's queues, Xendivel is now capable of dispatching invoice or refund emails to the queue for background execution, enabling your app to respond to other requests or do other tasks without waiting for the emails to finish. This will improve overall user experience!

### Webhook Setup

Xendivel ships with built-in webhook event listeners. Whenever you create an eWallet charge, refund, or void payment, Xendivel will automatically respond to webhook events as well as verifying the webhook origin. You can publish Xendivel's webhook event listeners:

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xendivel-webhook-listener
```

The Events and Listeners files will be published under `app/Events` and `app/Listeners` respectively.

> Note: Xendivel will automatically verify the webhook callback origin, you don't need to do anything else so long as you supplied the XENDIT_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN on your .env file.

After this, you should ensure that you setup a webhook URL from Xendit's dashboard under **eWallet Payment Status**:

https://dashboard.xendit.co/settings/developers#webhooks

The default endpoint for Xendivel webhook is `/xendit/webhook`. This is defined in Xendivel's config file `config/xendivel.php`.

Of course when defining webhook on Xendit, you should use absolute URL path (ex. https://your-domain.test/xendit/webhook) and your app should have `https` enabled.

When developing on your local machine, it's essential to make your local project accessible remotely. This can be achieved by utilizing localhost tunneling software such as [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com), [Expose](https://expose.dev), or any tool of your preference. The crucial aspect in this context is ensuring that your local project is reachable from external sources. This accessibility is crucial for Xendit to effectively send webhook callbacks to your application.

### Configuration File

Publish Xendivel's assets and configuration file to your Laravel application's config directory using the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xendivel-config
```

Executing this command will publish Xendivel's config file to your Laravel app's config directory.

## Checkout Templates

![Checkout Template](docs/image_assets/checkout-template.png)

Xendivel ships with a complete, fully working checkout template for cards and eWallet payments. The template include various variants such as **ReactJS component**, **ReactJS+TypeScript** component, and a regular **Blade** template and **VanillaJS**.

You can choose between the currently available template variants, you can even create your own.

### Example Checkout

Xendivel has a built-in route to preview the example checkout template (Blade). It's highly recommended to inspect the template as building the UI for checkout pages requires you to implement Xendit.js library for tokenization:

```
https://your-domain.test/xendivel/checkout/blade
```

> Note: Make sure you replace the `your-domain.test` with your own domain (whether local or production).

### Blade Template

We offer a standard Blade template for the checkout example, using VanillaJS. There's a built-in route allowing you to test this template at `/xendivel/checkout/blade`. You can access it through a URL like `https://your-domain.test/xendivel/checkout/blade`.

> NOTE: When you run the command `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xendivel-views` the checkout blade template will be on your `/resources/views/vendor/xendivel/checkout.blade.php` directory.

### ReactJS + TypeScript component

Xendivel also have a checkout template component for **ReactJS** or **React+TypeScript** for those who are using front-end frameworks like React instead of regular Blade template.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xendivel-checkout-react-typescript

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xendivel-checkout-react
```

These will be published under `/resources/js/vendor/xendivel/Checkout.tsx` for React+TypeScript or  `/resources/js/vendor/xendivel/Checkout.jsx` for plain ReactJS.

After publishing either one of these templates, please make sure you filled up the `public key` section on these React templates. Since this is a public key, it's perfectly safe to publish it directly on your templates.

```javascript
// Set your 'public' key here.
Xendit.setPublishableKey(
    'your-public-key',
)
```

These templates demonstrate card tokenization, credit/debit card, and eWallet payments. They serve to guide your payment collection process for implementation in your front-end stack. Alternatively, use them as fully functional standalone templates if you wish.

## Usage

### Credit/Debit Card Payments

#### About Credit/Debit Card Tokenization

Xendit employs a secure method for collecting credit or debit card details known as **tokenization**. The idea is instead of transmitting sensitive credit card information to your back-end, you utilize Xendit's JavaScript library to "tokenize" the card details before securely transmitting them to your back-end.

With this approach, there's no need to transmit your customer's card number, expiry date, and CVV (Card Verification Value) to the back-end for payment processing. Instead, these details are converted into secure **"tokens."** This ensures that even if leaked, your customer's credit/debit card information remains safe and confidential.

For more details, refer to Xendit's documentation below:

https://docs.xendit.co/credit-cards/integrations/tokenization

Xendivel provides convenient templates **(ReactJS, React+TypeScript, and Blade)** that serve as fully functional checkout components for card/eWallet payments, offering a solid starting point. Refer to the [Checkout templates](#checkout-templates) section for more details.

#### Charge Credit/Debit Cards

The `Xendivel::payWithCard` function accepts the incoming request payload with the `token_id`, `amount`, and `authentication_id`:

**Example POST Request from Axios**

```javascript
axios.post('/pay-with-card', {
    amount: 1200,
    token_id: 'card-token', // From card tokenization process.
    authentication_id: 'auth-id', // From authentication process.
    // Additional optional parameters:

    // external_id: 'your-custom-external-id',

    // descriptor: "Merchant Business Name",

    // currency: 'PHP',

    // metadata: {
    //     store_owner: 'Glenn Raya',
    //     nationality: 'Filipino',
    //     product: 'MacBook Pro 16" M3 Pro',
    //     other_details: {
    //         purpose: 'Work laptop',
    //         issuer: 'Xendivel LTD',
    //         manufacturer: 'Apple',
    //         color: 'Silver'
    //     }
    // }

    // billing_details: {
    //     given_names: 'Glenn',
    //     surname: 'Raya',
    //     email: 'glenn@example.com',
    //     mobile_number: '+639171234567',
    //     phone_number: '+63476221234',
    //     address:{
    //         street_line1: 'Ivory St. Greenfield Subd.',
    //         street_line2: 'Brgy. Coastal Ridge',
    //         city: 'Balanga City',
    //         province_state: 'Bataan',
    //         postal_code: '2100',
    //         country: 'PH'
    //     }
    // },
})
// ...
```

**Then, in your Laravel route or controller**

`POST` Request:

```php
Route::post('/pay-with-card', function (Request $request) {
    $payment = Xendivel::payWithCard($request)
        ->getResponse();

    return $payment;
});
```

The JSON response would look like this:

```json
{
  "status": "CAPTURED",
  "authorized_amount": 5198,
  "capture_amount": 5198,
  "currency": "PHP",
  "metadata": {},
  "credit_card_token_id": "656ed874edab5300169c3092",
  "business_id": "6551f678273a62fd8d86e25a",
  "merchant_id": "104019905",
  "merchant_reference_code": "656ed874edab5300169c3091",
  "external_id": "43565633-dd58-47ae-bbe6-648f78d6652c",

  "descriptor": "XDT*JSON FAKERY",
  "authorization_id": "656ed87c23f3c20015e2fb95",
  "bank_reconciliation_id": "7017631974056110603955",
  "issuing_bank_name": "PT BANK NEGARA INDONESIA TBK",
  "cvn_code": "M",
  "approval_code": "831000",
  "created": "2023-12-05T07:59:58.453Z",
  "id": "656ed87e23f3c20015e2fb96",
  "card_fingerprint": "61d6ed632aa321002350e0b2"
}

```

Xendit accepts optional parameters such as **`billing_details`**, **`metadata`**,  **`external_id`**, **`currency`**,  and **`descriptor`** as demonstrated in the Axios request above. You can refer to Xendit's documentation to learn more about these parameters:

https://developers.xendit.co/api-reference/#create-charge

> You can also forward an invoice in PDF format as an email attachment to your customer's email address. Details about this process are covered in the [PDF Invoicing](#pdf-invoicing) section.

#### Card Payment External ID
Xendit requires the inclusion of an `external_id` parameter in each credit/debit card charge. By default, Xendivel simplifies this process by generating a unique external ID using Ordered UUID v4 (https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/strings#method-str-ordered-uuid) automatically for you.

Nevertheless, if you opt to create your own `external_id` for some reason, you can achieve this by setting the `auto_id` option in the **xendivel.php** config file to **`false`**.

Config file: `config/xendivel.php`

```php
 'auto_id' => false,
```


Subsequently, ensure that you manually provide your custom `external_id` for each card charge request.

```javascript
axios.post('/pay-with-card', {
    amount: 1200,
    token_id: 'card-token', // From card tokenization process.
    authentication_id: 'auth-id', // From authentication process.
    external_id: 'your-custom-external-id', // Provide your own external id.
})
```

#### Get Card Charge Transaction

To retrieve the details of the card charge object, you must provide the **id** of the card charge (which should be sourced from your database or the Xendit dashboard) as the first parameter, and the string **card** as the second parameter.

`GET` Request:

```php
Route::get('/payment', function () {
    // card charge id example: 659518586a863f003659b718
    $response = Xendivel::getPayment('card-charge-id', 'card')
        ->getResponse();

    return $response;
});
```

This endpoint will return a JSON response that shows important details like the `status` of the card charge, `charge_type`, `card_type`, `card_brand`, etc.

```json
{
  "created": "2020-01-08T04:49:08.815Z",
  "status": "CAPTURED",
  "business_id": "5848fdf860053555135587e7",
  "authorized_amount": 10000,
  "external_id": "test-pre-auth",
  "merchant_id": "xendit",
  "merchant_reference_code": "598942aabb91a4ec309e9a35",
  "card_type": "CREDIT",
  "masked_card_number": "400000XXXXXX0002",
  "charge_type": "SINGLE_USE_TOKEN",
  "card_brand": "VISA",
  "bank_reconciliation_id": "5132390610356134503009",
  "capture_amount": 9900,
  "descriptor": "My new store",
  "id": "659518586a863f003659b718"
}
```

#### Multi-use Card Token

It's a common practice in e-commerce platforms to offer customers the convenience of saving their credit/debit card details for future use, eliminating the need for repetitive data entry during subsequent payments.

This functionality is achieved through the card tokenization process. If you've examined the [checkout templates](#checkout-templates) included with Xendivel, you'll find that this process has already been implemented for you.

Example JSON response for multi-use card token:

```json
{
  "status": "CAPTURED",
  "authorized_amount": 5198,
  "capture_amount": 5198,
  "currency": "PHP",
  "metadata": {},
  "credit_card_token_id": "65715e52689dc6001715bc57",
  "business_id": "6551f678273a62fd8d86e25a",
  "merchant_id": "104019905",
  "merchant_reference_code": "65715e530e502a00161aa2d9",
  "external_id": "f4270ddb-650d-4973-8786-1f5b4c048c76",
  "eci": "02",
  "charge_type": "MULTIPLE_USE_TOKEN",
  "masked_card_number": "520000XXXXXX1005",
  "card_brand": "MASTERCARD",
  "card_type": "CREDIT",
  "ucaf": "AJkBBkhgQQAAAE4gSEJydQAAAAA=",
  "descriptor": "XDT*JSON FAKERY",
  "authorization_id": "65715e5d689dc6001715bc5b",
  "bank_reconciliation_id": "7019285426096226603954",
  "issuing_bank_name": "PT BANK NEGARA INDONESIA TBK",
  "cvn_code": "M",
  "approval_code": "831000",
  "created": "2023-12-07T05:55:43.603Z",
  "id": "65715e5f689dc6001715bc60",
  "card_fingerprint": "61d6ed632aa321002350e0b2"
}

```
**Note:** When `charge_type` is `MULTIPLE_USE_TOKEN`, you should make sure that you save the `credit_card_token_id` to your database. You will use this token to charge the card again in the future without re-entering the card details again.

### eWallet Payments
Xendivel is compatible with all eWallet payment channels supported by Xendit. For further details, refer to the documentation at https://docs.xendit.co/ewallet, and explore Xendit's API reference at https://developers.xendit.co/api-reference/#create-ewallet-charge.

#### Charge eWallet

Example Axios post request:

```javascript
axios
    .post('/pay-via-ewallet', {
        // You can test different failure scenarios by using the 'magic amount' from Xendit.
        amount: parseInt(amount),
        currency: 'PHP',
        checkout_method: 'ONE_TIME_PAYMENT',
        channel_code: 'PH_GCASH',
        channel_properties: {
            success_redirect_url:
                'https://your-domain.test/ewallet/success',
            failure_redirect_url: 'https://your-domain.test/ewallet/failed',
        },
    })
    .then(response => {
        // Upon successful request, you will be redirected to the eWallet's checkout url.
        console.log(response.data)
        window.location.href =
            response.data.actions.desktop_web_checkout_url
    })
    /// ...
```

In the example Axios request above you will be redirected to the eWallet payment provider's checkout page to complete the verification there. If you are on development mode, you will see something like this: **(Insert Test eWallet Payment Page)**

Then, on your Laravel route or controller:

`POST` Request:

```php
Route::post('/pay-via-ewallet', function (Request $request) {
    $response = Xendivel::payWithEwallet($request)
        ->getResponse();

    return $response;
});
```

The resulting JSON response would look like this:

```json
{
    "created": "2023-12-09T07:51:17.926Z",
    "business_id": "6551f678273a62fd8d86e25a",
    "event": "ewallet.capture",
    "data": {
        "id": "ewc_5b2ad2c6-11a3-410a-b5ab-b41d16e39879",
        "basket": null,
        "status": "SUCCEEDED",
        "actions": {

            "desktop_web_checkout_url": "https://ewallet-mock-connector.xendit.co/v1/ewallet_connector/checkouts?token=clq1oqg032dn7a8hko1g",
            "mobile_deeplink_checkout_url": null
        },
        "created": "2023-12-09T07:51:06.63582Z",
        "updated": "2023-12-09T07:51:17.780894Z",
        "currency": "PHP",
        "customer": null,
        "metadata": null,
        "voided_at": null,
        "capture_now": true,
        "customer_id": null,
        "void_status": null,
        "callback_url": "https://pktuw9nrxn.sharedwithexpose.com/xendit/webhook",
        "channel_code": "PH_GCASH",
        "failure_code": null,
        "reference_id": "90c0c5f5-c6f0-4f2e-bf6c-f23763911f8a",
        "charge_amount": 1000,
        "capture_amount": 1000,
        "checkout_method": "ONE_TIME_PAYMENT",
        "refunded_amount": null,
        "payment_method_id": null,
        "channel_properties": {
            "failure_redirect_url": "https://package.test/ewallet/failed",
            "success_redirect_url": "https://package.test/ewallet/success"
        },
        "is_redirect_required": true,
        "payer_charged_amount": null,
        "shipping_information": null,
        "payer_charged_currency": null
    },
    "api_version": null
}

```

Upon the successful completion of the payment, you will be seamlessly redirected to the designated success or failure page URL as specified in your axios request parameters (`success_redirect_url` or `failure_redirect_url`).

#### Responding to eWallet Charge Webhook Event

By default, Xendivel will listen to `xendit/webhook` URL for callbacks as defined in Xendivel's config file whenever you make an eWallet charge, refund, or void transactions. You have the option to change the default webhook URL if you prefer:

`config/xendivel.php`

```php
'webhook_url' => '/xendit/webhook', // You can change this to whatever you like if you prefer.
```

Then, after you published Xendivel's webhook event listeners

#### Get eWallet Charge

Fetch the details of an eWallet charge. The `Xendivel::getPayment` function accepts the **eWallet charge ID** as the first parameter, and the type of charge which is **ewallet** as the second parameter.

`GET` Request:

```php
Route::get('/get-ewallet-charge', function (Request $request) {
	$response = Xendivel::getPayment('ewc_65cbfb33-a1ea-4c32-a6f3-6f8202de9d6e', 'ewallet')
			->getResponse();

	return $response;
});
```

The JSON response would look similar to this:

```json
{
  "id": "ewc_bb8c3po-c3po-r2d2-c3po-r2d2c3por2d2",
  "business_id": "5f218745736e619164dc8608",

  "capture_amount": 1000,
  "refunded_amount": null,
  "checkout_method": "ONE_TIME_PAYMENT",
  "channel_code": "ID_SHOPEEPAY",
  "channel_properties": {
    "success_redirect_url": "https://dashboard.xendit.co/register/1"
  },
  "actions": {
    "desktop_web_checkout_url": null,

#### Void eWallet Charge

`POST` Request:

```php
Route::post('/ewallet/void', function(Request $request) {
    // Example eWallet charge ID: ewc_e743d499-baa1-49f1-96c0-cc810890739b
    $response = Xendivel::void($request->ewallet_charge_id)
        ->getResponse();

    return $response;
});
```

With this Void API, you can nullify a successfully processed eWallet payment, ensuring that the entire original amount is refunded to the end user.

Voiding an eWallet charge is defined as the cancellation of eWallet payments created within the same day and before the **cutoff time of 23:50:00 (UTC+07:00 for Indonesia eWallets/ UTC+08:00 for Philippines eWallets)**.

-   Void API will only work for charges created via the `/ewallets/charges` API with `SUCCEEDED` status
-   Void API will return `PENDING` `void_status` in API response upon execution. A follow-up webhook will be sent to your system's URL when void has been processed successfully.

**To cancel eWallet payments after the aforementioned cutoff time, the [Refund API](#ewallet-payment-refund) should be used.**
