### Pre-requisites

- Laravel 9 or higher

## Installation

**Composer**

Xendivel utilizes Composer's package auto-discovery. All you need to do is to install Xendivel via composer and it will automatically register itself.

```bash
composer install glennraya/xendivel
```

## Initial Setup

### Xendit API Keys

Prior to using Xendivel, it's essential to have a Xendit account with properly configured API keys. Activation of your Xendit account for production is not necessary to test Xendivel's features. Test mode will be automatically enabled upon signing up for a Xendit account. Obtain your API keys from the following URLs:

- Secret Key/Public Key: https://dashboard.xendit.co/settings/developers#api-keys
- Webhook Verification Token: https://dashboard.xendit.co/settings/developers#webhooks

Generate `Money-In` `secret key` with `read` and `write` permissions from your dashboard API keys section.

After you acquired all these keys, please make sure you include them to your Laravel's `.env` file:

```ini
XENDIT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
XENDIT_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
XENDIT_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=your-webhook-verification-token
```

### Configure Laravel Mail (Optional)

Xendivel can send invoices to your customers as email attachments. To utilize this feature, ensure your [Laravel Mail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/mail#main-content) configuration is correctly set up. Before Xendivel dispatches invoice or refund email notifications, ensure your mail credentials are filled in your `.env` file.

```ini
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-mailer-host
MAIL_PORT=your-mailer-port
MAIL_USERNAME=your-mailer-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-mailer-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="fromaddress@example.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

### Jobs/Queues (Optional, but highly recommended)

Xendivel facilitates the queuing of email processes for background execution. If you intend to employ queued emails for tasks such as invoicing or refund notifications, ensure that you have properly configured Laravel's jobs/queues.

https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues#main-content

Then, make sure you have a queue worker running:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

Once you have successfully configured Laravel's queues, Xendivel is now capable of dispatching invoice or refund emails to the queue for background execution, enabling your app to respond to other requests or do other tasks without waiting for the emails to finish. This will improve overall user experience!

### Configuration File

Publish Xendivel's assets and configuration file to your Laravel application's config directory using the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xendivel-config
```

Executing this command will publish Xendivel's config file to your Laravel app's config directory.

## Checkout Templates

![Checkout Template](docs/image_assets/checkout-template.png)

Xendivel ships with a complete, fully working checkout template for cards and eWallet payments. The template include various variants such as **ReactJS component**, **ReactJS+TypeScript** component, and a regular **Blade** template and **VanillaJS**.

You can choose between the currently available template variants, you can even create your own.

### Example Checkout

Xendivel has a built-in route to preview the example checkout template (Blade):

```
https://your-domain.test/xendivel/checkout/blade
```

> Note: Make sure you replace the `your-domain.test` with your own domain (whether local or production).

### ReactJS + TypeScript component `.tsx`:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xendivel-checkout-react-typescript
```

This will be published under `/resources/js/vendor/xendivel` directory.

### ReactJS component `.jsx`:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xendivel-checkout-react
```

This will be published under `/resources/js/vendor/xendivel` directory.

### Blade Template

We offer a standard Blade template for the checkout example, complemented by VanillaJS. In Xendivel, there's a dedicated route allowing you to preview this template at `/xendivel/checkout/blade`. You can access it through a URL like `https://your-domain.test/xendivel/checkout/blade`.

> NOTE: When you run the command `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=xendivel-views` the blade template will be on your `/resources/views/vendor/xendivel` directory.

These templates demonstrate card tokenization, credit/debit card, and eWallet payments. They serve to guide your payment collection process for implementation in your front-end stack. Alternatively, use them as fully functional standalone templates if you wish.

## Usage

### Credit/Debit Card Payments

#### About Credit/Debit Card Tokenization

Xendit employs a secure method for collecting credit or debit card details known as **"tokenization."** Instead of transmitting sensitive credit card information to your back-end, you utilize Xendit's JavaScript library to "tokenize" the card details before securely transmitting them to your back-end.

With this approach, there's no need to transmit your customer's card number, expiry date, and CVV (Card Verification Value) to the back-end for payment processing. Instead, these details are converted into secure **"tokens."** This ensures that even if intercepted, your customer's credit/debit card information remains safe and confidential.

For more details, refer to Xendit's documentation below:

https://docs.xendit.co/credit-cards/integrations/tokenization

If you don't want to create the "card tokenization" user-interface yourself, Xendivel provides convenient templates **(React, React+TypeScript, and Blade)** that serve as fully functional checkout components for card/eWallet payments, offering a solid starting point. Refer to the [Checkout templates](#checkout-templates) section for more details.

#### Charge Credit/Debit Cards

The `Xendivel::payWithCard` function accepts the incoming request payload with the `token_id`, `amount`, and `authentication_id`:

**Example POST Request from Axios**

```javascript
axios.post('/pay-with-card', {
    amount: 1200,
    token_id: 'card-token', // From card tokenization process.
    authentication_id: 'auth-id', // From authentication process.
    // Additional optional parameters:

    // external_id: 'your-custom-external-id',

    // descriptor: "Merchant Business Name",

    // currency: 'PHP',

    // metadata: {
    //     store_owner: 'Glenn Raya',
    //     nationality: 'Filipino',
    //     product: 'MacBook Pro 16" M3 Pro',
    //     other_details: {
    //         purpose: 'Work laptop',
    //         issuer: 'Xendivel LTD',
    //         manufacturer: 'Apple',
    //         color: 'Silver'
    //     }
    // }

    // billing_details: {
    //     given_names: 'Glenn',
    //     surname: 'Raya',
    //     email: 'glenn@example.com',
    //     mobile_number: '+639171234567',
    //     phone_number: '+63476221234',
    //     address:{
    //         street_line1: 'Ivory St. Greenfield Subd.',
    //         street_line2: 'Brgy. Coastal Ridge',
    //         city: 'Balanga City',
    //         province_state: 'Bataan',
    //         postal_code: '2100',
    //         country: 'PH'
    //     }
    // },
})
// ...
```

**Then, in your Laravel route or controller**

```php
Route::post('/pay-with-card', function (Request $request) {
    $payment = Xendivel::payWithCard($request)
        ->getResponse();

    return $payment;
});
```

Xendit accepts optional parameters such as **`billing_details`**, **`external_id`**, **`currency`**,  and **`descriptor`**. You can refer to Xendit's documentation to learn more about these parameters:

https://developers.xendit.co/api-reference/#create-charge

> You can also forward an invoice in PDF format as an email attachment to your customer's email address. Details about this process are covered in the [PDF Invoicing](#pdf-invoicing) section.

#### Card Payment External ID
Xendit requires the inclusion of an `external_id` parameter in each credit/debit card charge. By default, Xendivel simplifies this process by generating a unique external ID using Ordered UUID v4 (refer to https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/strings#method-str-ordered-uuid).

Nevertheless, if you opt to create your own `external_id` for some reason, you can achieve this by setting the `auto_id` option in the **xendivel.php** config file to **`false`**. Subsequently, ensure that you manually provide your custom `external_id` for each card charge request.

```javascript
axios.post('/pay-with-card', {
    amount: 1200,
    token_id: 'card-token', // From card tokenization process.
    authentication_id: 'auth-id', // From authentication process.

	// Provide your own external_id implementation here...
    // external_id: 'your-custom-external-id',
})
```

#### Get Card Charge Transaction

To retrieve the details of the card charge object, you must provide the **id** of the card charge (which should be sourced from your database or the Xendit dashboard) as the first parameter, and the string **card** as the second parameter.

```php
Route::get('/payment', function () {
    // card charge id example: 659518586a863f003659b718
    $response = Xendivel::getPayment('card-charge-id', 'card')
        ->getResponse();

    return $response;
});
```

This endpoint will return a JSON response like this:

```json
{
  "created": "2020-01-08T04:49:08.815Z",
  "status": "CAPTURED",
  "business_id": "5848fdf860053555135587e7",
  "authorized_amount": 10000,
  "external_id": "test-pre-auth",
  "merchant_id": "xendit",

}
```
